  <h1>Forms</h1>
  <!--
    The form tag is used to create a container where all the inputs for a form must be put inside.
    The attributes that are required are name, id, and method.

    name gives us some descriptive information about what the form will be used for.

    id allows us to reference this form later in fieldsets and other areas of our code.
        
    method has two typical values: get and post. get is used for forms that do
    not ask for personal information (search bars, etc.). post is used for forms
    that ask for personal information (login and signup pages, etc.).
  -->
  <form name="musical-recommendations" id="musical-recs" method="get">
    <!--
      This is a text input. type="text", name, and id are all required attributes.
      The required attribute is only necessary when you want to make sure the user
      has to fill in the input before submitting the form.

      The type attribute defines the type of input.
      The name attribute defines the variable name that would be used for the input 
      when the data gets passed to the server (requires back-end scripting,
      which is beyond the scope of this course).
      The id attribute allows us to reference the input from the label and from 
      other parts of our code.

      All inputs need a label with the for attribute that links the label to the 
      input using the input's id attribute.
      When an input is required, it is important to include the word required 
      in the label's text 
    -->
    <label for="musical">Please Enter Something You Wish to Say [required]:</label>
    <input type="text" name="musical-suggestion" id="musical" required />

    <!--
      This is an email input. It requires type, name, and id.

      Optional attributes are minlength to define the minimum length entered by 
      the user, and maxlength to define the maximum length entered.
    -->
    <!-- 
      <label for="email-address">Please Enter Your E-mail Address:</label>
      <input type="email" name="email" id="email-address" minlength="6" maxlength="40"/>
    -->
        
    <!--
      This is a password input. type="password", name, and id are all required 
      attributes.
      As always, each input needs a label with the for attribute to link the label
      to an input.

      I have commented this input out because i will not be needing a password for this form.
    -->
    <!-- 
      <label for="pass">Please Enter Your Password:</label>
      <input type="password" name="user-password" id="pass" /> 
    -->
  </form>

  <h1>Testing Out Inputs</h1>
  <form name="testing-inputs" id="input-test" method="get">
    <!--
      A fieldset is an area in your form where you put inputs that are more related to each other
      than they are related to other inputs in the form (i.e., a list of travel items is more
      related to each other than the country the person is recommending)

      form is an important attribute to line the fieldset to the form it is related to.
    -->
    <fieldset>
      <!--
        A legend describes how the inputs inside the fieldset are all related.

      <!--
        This is a checkbox input. Note, this is an input where the input typically comes
        before the label.

        type="checkbox", name, and id are all required. The value attribute is also required 
        and provides its value to the server if the user checks that box and submits the form.
        In this case, what would be passed to the server is checkbox-test=check.
      -->

        <legend>Testing Radios</legend>
        <!--
          This is a radio button input, which are good when you want the user
          to select one option from a list of options

          name, id, and value are all required attributes. The value should represent
          to the choice the user has selected. Note, most importantly, the name attribute
          for each related radio button should be exactly the same.

          This is also an input where the label typically shows up after the input.
        -->
        <input type="radio" name="radio-test" id="test-radio" />

        If you can accomplish the same thing you want to do with a different
        type of input (i.e., radio buttons, text-based, etc.), you should use
        the other method of getting this information.
