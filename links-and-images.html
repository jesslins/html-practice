    <!--
      Paragraphs are an example of block elements because, by default, they take up
      the entire width of the webpage and add space at the top and bottom of the 
      element.
    -->
    <p>This web page shows the difference between block and inline elements!</p>

    <!-- 
      Anchors are an example of inline elements because, by default, they only take up
      the space that they need to.

      We showed the difference between block and inline elements using Developer Tools,
      which we accessed using Ctrl+Shift+I. Developer Tools is helpful to show you the
      exact code that is used to display a specific element and can show you the width,
      height, and spacing around an element.

      This is an example of an image tag.
      The src attribute is the location of the image we want to display.
      The src attribute can be an internet location (i.e., https://www.google.com/...),
      but the best practice is to have your own images folder that stores all the images 
      you use on your website.

      NOTE: img is a self-closing tag.

      They are close to the camera, with only their faces showing.
