        This is an example of an image tag.
        The src attribute is the location of the image we want to display.
        The src attribute can be an internet location (i.e., https://www.google.com/...),
        but the best practice is to have your own images folder that stores all the images 
        you use on your website.

        NOTE: img is a self-closing tag.

    <img 
        src="images/tanuki babies.jfif" 
        width="250"
        alt="A front view of four brown baby tanukis (Japanese raccoon dogs) in the forest. 
        Three are looking towards the camera, one is facing to the left."
